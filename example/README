1. data preparation and processing
#Put your templates and continuous seismic data in "Template" and "Trace", respectively.
#Seismic data in this example could be downloaded from Hi-net (http://www.hinet.bosai.go.jp/).
#Time window is from 2012/09/02 03:00:00.0 to 2012/09/02 03:59.59.99 in "Trace/20120902". [prepared already]
cd Template #make sure you have templates in SAC format with correct headers
unzip waveforms-of-templates.zip #unzip all templates
perl marktaup.pl #mark t1 and t2 for P and S waves, calculate slowness
#You need TauP and a local velocity model (if not, use prem or iasp91)

cd ../Trace #continuous data
#make sure both templates and continuous have the same station, sampling rate, and frequency filtering.  
perl SACH_O.pl 20120902 #All time will be relative to ZERO of the day.


2. run Match&Locate
perl RunprocAll.pl catalog.dat 
#change corresponding parameters in RunproAll.pl and PROC_MatchLocate.pl

3. select events (in case one event is detected by multiple templates)
cd MultipleTemplate
perl SelectFinal.pl 2012 09 02 #merge all events and select final events, change threshold as needed
#DetectedFinal.dat would be your final catalog
perl PlotEventWaveform.pl DetectedFinal.dat #plot waveform comparison 

Format:
INPUT.in [input for Match&Locate]
    21 //number of channels
    template_dir  trace_dir   horizontal_slowness/vertical_slowness  phase_marker Phase_name
    ...
    ...

EventCase.out [output by Match&Locate, temporary file]
    (result for one template)
    Event     Time    Lat.   Lon.    Depth    Mag.   Coef.  N*(MAD)


DetectedFinal.dat [final catalog]
#No.      Date        Time         Lat.      Lon.        Dep.     Mag.   Coef.     N(*MAD)        Reference
